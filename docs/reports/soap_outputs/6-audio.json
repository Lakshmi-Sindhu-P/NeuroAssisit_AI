      "subjective": "A 48-year-old lady with a history of hypertension for the last 3 years, well-controlled on Telmisartan Chlorthalidone 12.5mg with 40mg combination. She has a history of right optic neuritis in 2023, which was treated with methylprednisolone 1 gram for three days, leading to complete recovery. An MRI brain at that time was essentially normal, and VEP had shown prolonged right B100 latencies. For the last few days, she has noted blurring of vision on the left side. She reports no other neurological symptoms.",
      "objective": "Ophthalmic assessment shows vision of 6/9 on the right eye and 6/12 on the left side, with visual field defects. There is an afferent pupillary defect on the left side. Fundus examination reveals mild temporal pallor (right more than left) with arteriolar attenuation and Grade 2 hypertensive changes. Clinical examination shows full eye movements, no bulbar dysfunction, and bilaterally symmetrical effluntars flexa.",
      "assessment": "Impression of recurrent optic neuritis, initially left, now right. Newly diagnosed Diabetes Mellitus, for which she was initiated on oral hypoglycemic drugs: metformin with glimipride (Azomet G1).",
      "plan": "Order an MRI brain with contrast. Perform NMO mock to test. Restart on methylprednisolone 1 gram daily for 3 days. Monitor blood sugars and blood pressure, and implement diet modification during the steroid course. Start pantoprazole 40 milligrams once daily along with steroids. Order CBC, ESR, CRP, creatinine, vitamin B12, and vitamin D levels."
