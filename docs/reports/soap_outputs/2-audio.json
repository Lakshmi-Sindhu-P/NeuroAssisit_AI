      "subjective": "Patient presents with a history of medically refractive seizures since 3 months of age. Seizures involve hypermotor movements on the right side, described as a mild hemipalysmus, with eye and head deviation to the right, lasting approximately 30 seconds to a minute. Previously experienced daily seizures and never attended school due to the condition. Most seizures occur in sleep or upon waking. Patient has a history of trying multiple anti-seizure medications including Encore Chrono 400mg BID, Clobazam 5mg BID, Carbamazepine up to 800mg/day, Levetiracetam 1g daily, and Lamotrigine 100kg daily. A notable adverse event was drug-induced pancytopenia, leading to medication readjustment. No family history of seizures is reported, and genetic workup has not been performed to date.",
      "objective": "Previous video EEG in 2012 (at age 12) demonstrated right frontal central spikes with slowing of the right hemisphere; two focal unilateral seizures were recorded from the right frontal regions. MRI brain showed mild diffuse atrophy but was otherwise essentially normal. The patient is currently on regular follow-up with a neurologist and is prescribed the following medications: Encore Chrono 500mg BID, Perampanel 8mg HS, Clobazam 30mg daily, Lacosamide 200mg BID, Zonisamide 100mg BID, Topiramate (Topamak) 100mg BID, along with folic acid and nutritional supplements.",
      "assessment": "Impression is drug refractory epilepsy. The etiology requires further assessment with video EEG.",
      "plan": "Admission for video EEG is needed. Further action will be determined based on the findings of the video EEG. Review for video EEG admission."
